## Connection Profile

An application identifies those peers which can generate event notifications
using a connection profile:

```JavaScript
peer2.digibank.com:
  endorsingPeer: true
  chaincodeQuery: false
  ledgerQuery: true
  eventSource: true
```

See how `peer2` is identified as a source of events.
